    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. In simpler terms, it helps us understand how the execution time of an algorithm increases with larger inputs. An algorithm is considered efficient when its time complexity grows at a manageable rate, ensuring that it remains feasible even for larger datasets.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. It's a measure of how the memory requirements of an algorithm change with input size. When analyzing space complexity, we often encounter the notation "O(n)," where "n" represents the input size. This notation signifies that the space used by the algorithm increases linearly with the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in environments with limited memory resources, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.
